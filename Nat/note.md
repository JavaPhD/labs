## stands for
network address translation  
- translate private IP to public IP
- translate public IP to private IP

## purpose:
preserve the limited amount of IPV4 public address  

|IP|Example|what is it|notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|public|66.94.234.13|public registered on the internet|must have a public IP to access the internet|
|private|10.0.0.1|Not public registered| <ul><li>cant access internet</li><li>cannot directly access internet with a private IP</li></ul>|

In future, IPV6 wont need private IP or NAT
